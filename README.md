# Word Embedding Explorer

This project provides an interactive platform for exploring word embeddings using pre-trained models from the Gensim library. It features a comprehensive Streamlit web application that allows users to visualize and analyze semantic relationships between words.

## Project Overview

Word embeddings are vector representations of words that capture semantic meanings and relationships. This application demonstrates how these embeddings can be used to:
- Find semantically similar words
- Measure similarity between word pairs
- Solve word analogies
- Visualize word clusters
- Explore vector operations on words

## Features

### Find Similar Words
This feature finds words with similar vector representations to a given input word.

**Implementation:**
- Uses cosine similarity to find words closest to the input word in the embedding space
- Displays results as a ranked list with similarity scores
- Provides visualization options to see the relationships in 2D space

### Word Similarity
Calculates the similarity between two words based on their vector representations.

**Implementation:**
- Computes cosine similarity between word vectors
- Provides visual indicators of similarity strength
- Allows comparison of multiple word pairs

### Word Analogy
Solves word analogies by performing vector arithmetic (e.g., king - man + woman ‚âà queen).

**Implementation:**
- Uses vector addition and subtraction to solve analogies
- Visualizes the analogy relationships in the embedding space
- Provides multiple results ranked by similarity

### Word Clustering
Visualizes how groups of words cluster together in the embedding space.

**Implementation:**
- Applies dimensionality reduction to project word vectors into 2D space
- Offers both PCA and t-SNE visualization options
- Provides pre-defined categories and custom word input options

### Embedding Visualization
Explores vector operations on words and visualizes the results.

**Implementation:**
- Supports addition, subtraction, and custom weighted operations
- Visualizes the results of vector operations
- Shows how semantic meaning combines through vector arithmetic

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/word-embedding-explorer.git
cd word-embedding-explorer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

To explore the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Simple_Word2Vec_Project.ipynb
```

## Models

The application supports several pre-trained word embedding models:
- **GloVe (Wikipedia, 100d)**: Trained on Wikipedia data with 100-dimensional vectors
- **GloVe (Wikipedia, 300d)**: Higher dimensional version for more nuanced representations
- **Word2Vec (Google News, 300d)**: Trained on Google News dataset with 300-dimensional vectors
- **FastText (Wikipedia, 300d)**: Includes subword information, better for rare words and morphologically rich languages

## Technical Implementation

### Model Loading and Caching
The application uses Streamlit's caching mechanism to avoid reloading models between sessions:

```python
@st.cache_resource
def load_model(model_name):
    return api.load(model_name)
```

### Dimensionality Reduction
For visualization, high-dimensional word vectors are reduced to 2D using either PCA or t-SNE:

```python
def visualize_words(words, method='pca'):
    # Get word vectors
    word_vectors = [wv[word] for word in words if word in wv]
    
    # Apply dimensionality reduction
    if method == 'pca':
        reducer = PCA(n_components=2)
    else:  # t-SNE
        reducer = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=42)
    
    # Reduce dimensions
    X_reduced = reducer.fit_transform(np.array(word_vectors))
    
    return X_reduced, words
```

### Vector Operations
Word analogies and other operations are implemented using vector arithmetic:

```python
# For analogies (A is to B as C is to ?)
result_vector = wv[word_a] - wv[word_b] + wv[word_c]
result_words = wv.similar_by_vector(result_vector, topn=n)
```

## Conclusions

This project demonstrates several key insights about word embeddings:

1. **Semantic Relationships**: Word embeddings effectively capture semantic relationships between words, with similar words clustering together in the vector space.

2. **Analogical Reasoning**: The vector arithmetic properties of word embeddings enable solving analogies, demonstrating how linguistic relationships are encoded mathematically.

3. **Visualization Insights**: Dimensionality reduction techniques reveal interesting clusters and relationships that might not be immediately obvious from raw similarity scores.

4. **Model Differences**: Different embedding models have different strengths and weaknesses, with some better at capturing certain types of relationships than others.

5. **Practical Applications**: Word embeddings provide a foundation for many NLP tasks, from semantic search to language understanding.

## Future Work

- Integration with transformer-based contextual embeddings (BERT, GPT)
- Support for multilingual embeddings
- Custom model training capabilities
- Enhanced visualization techniques
- Sentiment analysis based on word embeddings
